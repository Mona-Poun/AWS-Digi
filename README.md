### Project Description
Our main objective is to identify a dynamic dataset suitable for analysis through the platform, understand the key parameters of the dataset,parsing of the dataset,create a dashboard and generate alerts upon any anomalies recorded in the dataset.This project is all about how to analyze data real-time inside DNIF with the help of inbuilt function.  


# Introduction to DNIF
DNIF is a data platform that can collect, parse, enrich, index, balance, and analyse data in a continuously changing environment, helping enterprises take precautionary measures for cyber defence. It allows users to partition one data infrastructure and enable multiple teams to solve many challenges.

Apart from cybersecurity analytics, DNIF can also be used for any Big Data analytics use case, transaction analytics, fraud detection, analytics on IoT data, and financial risk analysis.

The platform offers consumers three types of deployment â€” on-premises (installed and runs on computers in the premises), on cloud, and virtual.

It offers four plans, including free, community, standard and enterprise, to suit the need and pocket of consumers. Consumers can subscribe as per usage and install DNIF on commodity servers. The software will then stream log data from servers, network devices, and security devices. Once downloaded, DNIF will ingest this data and identify threats using techniques like thresholding, lookups, profilers/baseliners, and machine learning.
